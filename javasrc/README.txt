Thanking:
    For this problem we have that the people that the four servants are doing operations without
    verification in their related works. So when one person may be removing a node, another could be adding presents
    in between that present and it's predecessor. Linking the removed present back to the chain.

    Something that we have learned that occurs during lock-free linked lists is validation and atomic operations
    In addition, there is the use of logical and physical deletions. Which is implemented with the use of marks
    
    So we must use a system to indicate that the present is removed. This could be the paper that will be used for
    the thank you note. It can be used as an indicator that the present must be taken out. But we could do this more simply.
    Given that ALL nodes will eventually be moved out, we can instead remove the very first element every time, that way there is no ambiguity.

    This is still an operation that can be overlapped by another removal, so we must add validation.
    Humans are sentient creatures and have very good memories. Thus they should be able to validate data.
